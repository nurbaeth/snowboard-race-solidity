# 🏂 Snowboard Race (Solidity Game)  
   
**Snowboard Race** is a fully on-chain, turn-based multiplayer game where players race down a snowy slope on snowboards. The game is implemented in pure Solidity, making every move verifiable, transparent, and trustless.

## ❄️ Gameplay Overview    
    
- 2–4 players per race     
- Each player takes turns "rolling a dice" (1–6)  
- First to reach the finish line wins  
- All logic is on-chain — no central control, no cheating

## 🧱 Built With  
  
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) — core game logic  
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) *(recommended)* for testing/deployment 
- [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/vrf/v2/introduction/) *(optional)* for real randomness

## 🎮 Game Flow  

1. **Create a race** 
    ```solidity  
    createGame(uint256 finishLine) 
    ```

2. **Join the race**
    ```solidity
    joinGame(uint256 gameId)
    ```

3. **Start racing**
    - Players take turns calling:
    ```solidity
    move(uint256 gameId, uint256 randomRoll)
    ```

4. **Win condition**
    - First to reach or exceed `finishLine` wins.

## 🔁 Example Turn

```solidity
// Player A rolls a 4
move(1, 4);

// Emits:
PlayerMoved(gameId=1, player=0xABC..., roll=4, newPosition=12)
